## About this dataset
-  From the Moorea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research project 
-  Time-series data on coral recruitment from 2006-2016
-  Collected from two different reef environments (lagoon and forereef)
-  And from different shore lines (west, east, north, and south)
-  3 different coral families: _Acroporidae_, _Pocilloporidae_, _Poritidae_

## What is a coral? 
- Plant (photosynthetic algal symbiont)
- Animal (coral host) 
- Rock (calcium carbonate skeleton)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Data", "IMG_6976.JPG"))
```

## What is coral recruitment? 
- The introduction of new individuals to a community 
- Increases genetic diversity 
- Aids in post-disturbance recovery 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Data", "IMG_7536.JPG"))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## Loading libraries and read in data```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(PNWColors)
library(kableExtra)

recruits <- read_csv(here("Data","coral_recruit_tile_spat_counts_2006-2016_20180626.csv"))
```

## Tidy the data 
- In a way that is useful for the plots and output we are trying to create  

- Want to look at the change in recruit species composition and abundance over the years between different habitats

```{r}
## ideally looking to combine total counts of all tiles and season into one count 
#per year by species 

recruityears <- recruits %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = side, values_from = count) %>% 
  filter(family!="Unidentified", ##this filters out these families and says side 
         #does NOT include"A"
         family!="Other") %>% ## was going to filter out by shore, but "west" is
  #only in 2006 
  select(-location, -A) %>%
  mutate(total_count = B+S+T) %>% 
  group_by(nominal_year, family, habitat) %>% 
  summarize(sum_total=sum(total_count))
  
```

## Total number of recruits by family per year 

```{r, recruit_total}
ggplot(data=recruityears, 
       aes(x=nominal_year, 
           y=sum_total, 
           fill=family)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Year", 
       y="Total Number of Recruits", 
       title="Total Number of Recruits by Family from 2006-2016", 
       fill="Coral Family", 
       subtitle = str_wrap("Shows a shift from Acropora to Pocillopora after 2007, which correlates with bleaching events from 2007. In 2011, lots of recruitment, which may be due to recovery post-cyclone.")) + 
  facet_wrap(~habitat) + 
  theme_linedraw() + 
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5), 
        axis.text.x=element_text(size=10, angle = 45, vjust=0.5), ##to get the x 
        #axis slightly angled so text is not on top of each other. vjust moves 
        #text away from the actual axis 
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=10), 
        axis.title.x=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.y=element_text(size=12)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 
                                2014, 2015, 2016)) + ##allows you to specifically 
  #decide what you want the column breaks to be 
  scale_fill_manual(values=pnw_palette("Sunset2", n=3))
ggsave(here("Outputs", "totalrecruitment2.jpg"), 
       width=10, height=7)
```

## Make a table to summarize the data 
```{r, table}

recruit_table <- recruityears %>% 
  select(family, sum_total, nominal_year) %>% 
  group_by(nominal_year, family) %>% 
  summarize(total=sum(sum_total))
  
recruit_table %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Summarize recruitment data from 3 coral families between 2006 
      and 2016") %>% 
  kable_minimal("hover", html_font = "Calibri", c("striped")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px") 
  
```
## Coding a *fancy* kable table  
```{r, echo=TRUE}

recruit_table <- recruityears %>% 
  select(family, sum_total, nominal_year) %>% 
  group_by(nominal_year, family) %>% 
  summarize(total=sum(sum_total))
  
recruit_table %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Summarize recruitment data from 3 coral families between 2006 
      and 2016") %>% 
  kable_minimal("hover", html_font = "Calibri", c("striped")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "100px") 

```

## Visualize which side of the tile most recruits settle on 
```{r, tile_side}
tileside <- recruits %>% 
  filter(family!="Unidentified", ##this filters out these families 
         family!="Other", 
         side!="A") %>% 
  select(-location) %>% ##removes columns by name
  group_by(family, side) %>% 
  summarize(sum_total=sum(count))

ggplot(data=tileside,
      aes(x=side, 
          y=sum_total, 
          fill=side)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~family) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(y="Total Number of Recruits", 
       x="Side of Recruitment Tile", 
       title="Corals Settle More on the Bottom of Recruitment Tiles",
       fill="Side of Tile") + 
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),
        axis.text.x=element_text(size=10), ##to get the x axis slightly angled so 
        #text is not on top of eachother. vjust moves text away from actual axis 
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=10), 
        axis.title.x=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.y=element_text(size=12)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Bottom", "Side", "Top")) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = pnw_palette("Bay", n=3))
ggsave(here("Outputs","tilelocation.jpg"), 
       height=7, width=10)
```

## Conclusion 
-  Corals prefer to settle on the bottom of the recruitment tiles 
-  A shift in _Acropora_ to _Pocillopora_ occurred in both the lagoon and the forereef 
-  Recruitment rates never really returned to levels pre-disturbance, though did have some bounce back after the cyclone.
