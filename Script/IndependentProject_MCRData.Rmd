```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)

## What is a coral? 
- Plant (photosynthetic algal symbiont)
- Animal (coral host) 
- Rock (calcium carbonate skeleton)

## What is coral recruitment? 
- The introduction of new individuals to a community 
- Increases genetic diversity 
- Aids in post-disturbance recovery 

## Different types of reef environments 
- Fringing reef (nearest the shore)
- Backreef (close to where the waves break)
- Forereef (usually closest to the reef wall which is in in open water and slopes/drops off to larger depths)

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
