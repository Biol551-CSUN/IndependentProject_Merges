This dataset is taken from the National Science Foundation funded Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research program (MCR LTER). There are 6 LTER sites around Mo'orea, which is part of French Polynesia, located in the South Pacific Ocean. 

These LTER sites have approximately 20 years of timeseries data that has monitored various aspects of the reef environments. This particuar dataset recorded coral recruitment in the lagoon and forereef environments at different LTER sites from 2006 to 2012. 

The following repository includes Script, Data, and Output folders. The components of each folder are as follows: 
-  Script has an RMarkdown file as well as the associated slides upon knitting the Markdown script 
-  Data has the downloaded MCR dataset and the data dictionary as well as the pictures used in my slides 
-  Output has the 3 different outputs and plots that help explore and analyze the data. One output is a table to summarize the data, and there are 2 bar plots that visualize different aspects of the recruitment data. 

This dataset comes from the time series data collected and published by CSUN professor, Dr. Peter Edmunds.
